# Data Visualization from default to outstanding. Test cases of tough data visualization problems with Python

A 2018 Data Science workshop.


## Important!

Code repository is here: https://github.com/bgbg/datascience_dataviz_workshop

1. **Make sure you meet all the requirements. We will not be able to support missing installations or non-working code**. The provided notebook `00-before-we-begin.ipynb` will take you through the verification process. It will make sure that you have all the required software installed, and that you have enough knowledge to proceed with the workshop. It is up to you to make sure that everything works.

2. Visit the [workshop repository](https://github.com/bgbg/datascience_dataviz_workshop) one day before the workshop. I will update that repository with code examples and data sets. You should have them on your computer before the workshop starts.

3. Please fill the [pre-workshop survey](http://bit.ly/ds2018dataviz), so that we can maximize the efficacy of this workshop.

## Setup
The easiest way to make sure you have all the required software is to use the supplied file to create a [conda environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

In your terminal, go to the directory that contains this notebook and type

```bash
conda env create -p ./dataviz-env -f ./environment.yml
```

This will create an environment in your local directory. Next, activate the environment and start the notebook.

```bash
source activate ./dataviz-env
jupyter notebook
```
## Code samples and data sets

I'll update this repository with code samples and data sets. Stay tuned!
